Quick View:

For this project, it smilier last project. it will take an argument that is filename by user input, then open the file, and read every line.
In my program, it can use "insert, search, debug, delete, preOrder, inOrder" commands to operate the AVLTree and it can create up to four AVLTree.
So, I completed all requirements, and my program works very well.

Notes:

I had a problem that I got wrong height after I rotate subtree, but I found the problem that I forget to reset subtree's nodes' height. Then, I fixed that.
